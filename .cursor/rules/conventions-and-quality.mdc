# Conventions & Quality

- Performance first: Prefer Server Components by default; keep Client Components only where interactivity is needed (`'use client'`).
- Strong typing: Use generated types from `@prisma/client` and avoid `any`. Narrow fields with `.select()` to limit payloads.
- Security: Never expose Prisma to the browser. All DB access must be via Server Components, Server Actions, or Route Handlers.
- Mutations: Implement with Server Actions (`'use server'`). Revalidate relevant paths with `revalidatePath` after writes.
- Source of truth: Treat [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) as canonical. Evolve schema via migrations, not manual DB edits.

See the full guidance in [README.md](mdc:README.md).
