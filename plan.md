# Project Plan

## Objective
- Align `claude.md` with the authoritative rules under `.cursor/rules` so Claude always references the latest guidance.

## Tasks
- [x] Review existing `claude.md` and linked rule sources.
- [x] Rewrite `claude.md` to emphasise living links to `cursor-rules.md` and `.cursor/rules` content.
- [x] Proofread updates to ensure clarity and compliance.

## Notes
- Maintain links rather than duplicating large rule sections so future updates cascade automatically.
